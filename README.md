## ⚙ Flags & Options

| Flag             | Short | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| `--tag`          | `-t`  | HTML tag or selector to scrape (default: `h1`) |

## 📌 Pro Tips
- Use CSS selector format for tags with classes:  
  `--tag "div.read__content"`
- If a site blocks requests, try with **custom headers or proxy** (coming soon).  
- Avoid scraping websites you don’t have permission to scrape.
